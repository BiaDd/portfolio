## About
A web application for storing and tracking information on a personâ€™s various pets. A user logs in and can create new pet entries. These entries include things like an image, pet type, name, birthday, food, immunizations, etc. A calendar is available for scheduling walks, vacations (and having people watch the pets), and visits to the vet.
